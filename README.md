# ALL-IN-ONE APP

It’s a learning project I built to deepen my understanding of core web-development fundamentals using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal of this project is to bring multiple mini-apps and tools into one place while practicing concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, API usage, localStorage, modular code structure, and UI design.

This project acts as a personal playground where I experiment with essential front-end skills such as:

• Building reusable functions

• Managing state without frameworks

• Handling user interactions efficiently

• Fetching and displaying real-time data

• Structuring a scalable JavaScript project

• Designing clean and minimal UI layouts


## Getting Started

### Step 1

run to clone the repo
```bash
`git clone https://github.com/BhaskarParab/All-in-one_App.git
```
### Step 2
#### Either manually open home.html file on double click
or
#### Install Live Server VScode extension to open the app live on browser(recommended)

### Step 3

Three API's used in this app

1 OpenWeather API 

2 News API

3 Apple itunes API

You have to configure only 1 and 2, The 3rd API does't need API key

#### OpenWeather API

`https://openweathermap.org/`

#### News API

`https://newsapi.org/`

#### Create a file config.js 

add this code
